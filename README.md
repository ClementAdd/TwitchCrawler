### Description:

This project was created for a school project.<br>
This project consists of retrieving some information from a web page.
In our case, we recover the top 30 streamers online on the Twitch platform sorted by number of viewers.

### Implementation details:

We have created a web server in NodeJS.
<br>
To access to the website, we use Puppeteer which is a Node library, developed by Google which allows you to control an instance of the Chrome Headless browser (Chrome without UI).
